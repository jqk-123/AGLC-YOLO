component in the automated analysis of remote sensing imagery, with direct implications for applications such as geographic information systems (GIS), urban planning, and environmental monitoring. However, high intra-class scale variation, background clutter, and frequent occlusion present persistent challenges for robust detection in this domain. To address these issues, we propose an improved detection architecture based on YOLOv11, termed AGLC-YOLO, which is designed to optimize the trade-offs between detection accuracy, inference latency, and computational efficiency.
